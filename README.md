## Description

This project is a **full-stack industrial maintenance dashboard** built with **React**, **Node.js**, **GraphQL**, and a secure **MongoDB Atlas** backend. It simulates real-time plant data using an OPC UA server and delivers actionable insights to maintenance engineers and technicians.

- **Motivation**: Bring real-time equipment insights to maintenance teams using secure and modern web technologies.  
- **Reason**: Modern manufacturing environments generate dataâ€”this tool ensures maintenance personnel can see, understand, and act on that data quickly.  
- **Problem Solved**: MEAP connects industrial sensor data (simulated via OPC UA) to the cloud and presents it in a user-friendly dashboard.  
- **What I Learned**: Built a full industrial data pipeline using OPC UA, practiced secure data transport, GraphQL integration, and role-based frontend UX.

# Maintenance Engineer Assist Platform (MEAP)

## Overview
The **Maintenance Engineer Assist Platform (MEAP)** is a role-aware full-stack application tailored for industrial environments to help maintenance engineers, technicians (electrical, instrumentation), and mechanics monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize equipment performance.

The platform connects to a simulated OPC UA server for secure, real-time industrial data and supports historical analytics, equipment profile management, and fault logging/resolution workflows.

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (if used)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Apollo Server (GraphQL)
- **Database:** MongoDB + Mongoose (Atlas Cloud or local)
- **Auth:** JWT-based authentication, bcrypt for password hashing
- **Simulation:** Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Authentication & Roles
- Users authenticate with email/password
- JWTs issued upon login, stored in localStorage
- Two roles supported: `engineer`, `technician`
- Role-based UI rendering and access control

### 2.2 Dashboard
- Welcome message based on user profile
- KPI cards:
  - MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
  - MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)
  - Uptime %
  - Open Work Orders
- Equipment health and sensor data sections

### 2.3 Equipment Monitoring
- **Live Readings**: Recent data from sensors (temp, flow, vibration, etc.)
- **Historical Readings**: Trends over user-defined time ranges

### 2.4 Fault Logging
- Engineers/Techs can submit fault reports
- Faults tagged by type, severity, and notes
- Faults can be resolved via UI

### 2.5 User Profile Page
- View own stats or another userâ€™s by username
- Add/Edit profile info (in future update)
- Change password (planned)

---

## 3. Backend Details

### 3.1 Models
- **User**: email, username, hashed password, role
- **EquipmentProfile**: type, location, install date, tags
- **LiveReading** / **HistoricalReading**: metrics + timestamps
- **EquipmentFault**: type, severity, notes, resolved flag

### 3.2 GraphQL API
- **Queries:**
  - `me`
  - `equipmentProfiles`
  - `liveReadings(equipmentId: String!)`
  - `historicalReadings(equipmentId: String!, from: String!, to: String!)`
  - `equipmentFaults(equipmentId: String!)`
- **Mutations:**
  - `addUser(input: UserInput!)`
  - `login(email: String!, password: String!)`
  - `addEquipmentFault(input: FaultInput!)`
  - `resolveFault(faultId: ID!)`

## 4. Simulator Integration

### 4.1 Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server
- Chosen for macOS compatibility and secure transport
- Simulates equipment:
  - Pump
  - Conveyor
  - Checkweigher
  - Bagger
  - Robotic Palletizer

### 4.2 Integration Strategy
- Use `node-opcua` to connect to `opc.tcp://localhost:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer`
- Read selected tag values (temperature, motorStatus, flowRate, vibration)
- Save data to MongoDB as live readings using Mongoose
- Use a scheduled polling loop (e.g., every 5 seconds)
- Optional future logic to auto-log faults from abnormal readings

---

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Scripts
```bash
npm run install         # Installs server and client deps
npm run start:dev       # Dev mode (server + client concurrently)
npm run build           # Full build
npm run seed            # Seed DB with test data
```

### 5.2 Environments
- `.env` file used for storing:
  - MongoDB connection string (Atlas)
  - JWT secret keys
- Render (or Railway) used for backend hosting
- MongoDB Atlas with IP allow-listing for simulator security

---

## 6. Roadmap & Future Features
- Real-time WebSocket integration
- Equipment health scores
- Predictive fault alerts
- User avatars and profile editing
- Upload equipment images or documents
- Maintenance logs and work order tracking
- Notification system (email/SMS)
- Export readings to CSV/PDF

---

## 7. Credits
- Created by **Eddy Howell** for **Capstone Bootcamp (2025)**
- Simulated using [Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server](https://www.prosysopc.com)
